**[Visualizing the Housing Crisis](https://visualizinghousing.github.io)** is a data narrative focused on the affordable housing crisis in California. I sourced the data for and created the key data visualizations in Tableau. I also oversaw the narrative and design of the overall piece.

This project was my Masters of Information Management capstone project completed at the School of Information, University of California, Berkeley.
