Created for INFO 247: Information Visualization taught by Professor Marti Hearst in Spring 2022 at the School of Information, UC Berkeley.

This project also supported the MIMS Capstone Project, Algorithms Unwrapped.

Algorithms Unwrapped is a machine learning education tool to help social media users better understand their own algorithmic content feeds so that they can learn how the algorithm sees them, and reflect on what they really want out of their algorithmic content recommendations.
