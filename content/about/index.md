##### Hi, I'm Angela!

I am a Data Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Currently, I work on the Machine Learning team at Rebuy Engine, developing Machine Learning-enabling data infrastructure for e-commerce.

I hold a Master's degree in Information Management and Systems from the UC Berkeley School of Information. Professionally, I am interested in building scalable data systems, especially those that improve delivery of nonprofit and public services.

Prior to my Master's, I worked to improve the US healthcare system: first in healthcare finance consulting, followed by five years improving care for underserved populations at the Center for Care Innovations. I received my Bachelor's degree in Biology and Public Health from Williams College.

##### I nerd out about...

Backcountry & downhill skiing, climbing, road biking, equitable outdoors access, ceramics, knitting
